# GameJam2023
GameJam2023 at IUT2 Grenoble

Team members:
- Ilan Darmon
- Gabriel Schaal
- Yanis Harkati

We had 4 days to learn Python in order to create a game using the pygame library.

The game had to respect the following themes:
- The atmosphere: "The wonderful world of IUT2 Grenoble".
- The mechanism: follow the rhythm.
- A python constraint: configure the game by passing command line arguments.
