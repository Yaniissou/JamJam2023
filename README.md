# GameJam2023
GameJam2023 at IUT2 Grenoble

Team members:
- Ilan Darmon
- Gabriel Schaal
- Yanis Harkati

We had 4 days to learn Python in order to create a game using the pygame library.

The game had to respect the following themes:
- The atmosphere: "The wonderful world of IUT2 Grenoble".
- The mechanism: follow the rhythm.
- A python constraint: configure the game by passing command line arguments.


Figures:
- 109 students, 4 teams of 3 and 22 teams of 4
- Qualified for the semi-final among the top 6 best games
- Qualified for the final among the top 4 best games
- Final position: Top 3



Lore of the game:
"You've just flunked your mid-semester exams, and things aren't looking good :/. 
Your last chance? Get 20/20 on all your exams for the next week of midterms! 
Just when you've given up hope, a rumor starts to spread around the IUT:
There's a secret USB key in office 101, containing all the upcoming exams... 
Your objective? Equipped with a flashlight, you infiltrate the IUT by night to steal the key. But beware, strange things happen after school hours..."


Rules:
Use the arrow keys to find the USB flash drive, 
dodge the teachers and follow the beat of the music to mask your footsteps and avoid being spotted!
